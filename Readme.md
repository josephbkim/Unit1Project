Inspiration
This is a game I enjoyed as a kid with sibling, cousins, or friends.  I wanted to keep the games classic structure while adding elements that I enjoy today.

User Story
Page loads and allows player to enter name.  Player chooses Topic/Opponent.  Once both are selected player clicks start and the game is played out.  If player wins player win counter goes up.  If player loses cpu counter goes up.  Prompt asking play again.
